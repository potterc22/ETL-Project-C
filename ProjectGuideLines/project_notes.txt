Data Cleanup & Analysis
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:
	> The sources of data that you will extract from.
	> Scrape data from websites.
		> The names of candies on the websites are long.
	> Star rating (consider # of the ratings)
	> The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
		> Combining brand names in the table? 
		> Clean CSV for brand
	> The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
	> The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
